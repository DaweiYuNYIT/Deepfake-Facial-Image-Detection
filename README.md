# Deepfake-Facial-Image-Detection
An experimental study on detecting deepfake facial images using deep learning models: MesoInception4 model, followed by finetuned Xception and EfficientNetB0 models, trained on a Kaggle deepfake dataset. Results demonstrate that fine-tuned model Xception significantly outperform others.
